Step 1: Define the Project Requirements
Frontend: Static content (HTML, CSS, JS) to display user interface.
Backend: Dynamic processing using Flask, such as handling user requests, interacting with databases, or processing CVE data.
Deployment: Both frontend and backend need to be accessible, with clear separation of concerns:
Frontend on GitHub Pages for static hosting.
Backend on Heroku for dynamic server-side processing.
Step 2: Design the System Architecture
The system has two major parts:

Frontend (Client-Side): The static website hosted on GitHub Pages.

It will consist of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
JavaScript will handle making API calls to the backend (Flask).
Use fetch() or axios() to interact with the backend and display data dynamically on the page.
Backend (Server-Side): The Flask app hosted on Heroku.

It will expose APIs (e.g., /api/cve) for interacting with CVE data.
Flask will handle logic, database interactions (if required), and data processing.
Step 3: Develop the Backend (Flask App)
Create the Flask Application:
Set up routes to serve data (e.g., CVE information) and handle requests from the frontend.
Implement API endpoints for returning data in JSON format.
Database/External API (Optional):
If your backend is supposed to fetch real-time data (e.g., from a CVE database), set up integration with that data source.
CORS Handling:
Since the frontend and backend will be hosted on different domains, configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Flask to allow requests from GitHub Pages.
Step 4: Develop the Frontend (Static Website)
Design the User Interface:
The UI will be simple, with an input field for entering search criteria or parameters (like CVE IDs).
Display results dynamically by consuming the backend API.
Interaction with Backend:
Use JavaScript's fetch() or axios() to call the backend API hosted on Heroku.
Handle responses from the API and update the page dynamically.
